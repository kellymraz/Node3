	var http = require("http")

	varserver = http.createServer(function(request, ) {
		response.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type" : "text/plain "})
		response.end("h1>hello </h1>")

	})

	server.listen(9001)



	in browser bar type in localport:9001

	our server is passive and spends time waiting for requests
	we need to define what a server will do when it receives a request

	above we have created a server and defined what it will do when we get a request
	every http req or resp has headers, like the info on the outside of a letter

	the 200 is a status code.  200 means thumbs up, it worked out. Indicates to client that you recieved the request, understood it, created a response and am sending it back to you

	404 means file not found
	500 means the server threw an error
	so no answer for you

	most common are 200, 404, and 500

in {} shows the kind of information sent(images, text, css, javascript)

9001 is our port number
a port is like a port on a dock
your computer has its own address
the entire dock has an IP address and then each port on the dock has its own port address

usually this is port 80

You will want to use high-number (4-digit) ports as the lower numbers are reserved
for specific things

Once the response is sent the client stops listening

You need to restart your server each time you make a request

You are actually sending two requests everytime you send a reqeust to a web page

a post request has a body
a get request does not have a body so you have to attach data in the url bar string

You can have multiple ports on one server
